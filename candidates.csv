In 2021, I led a statewide team to develop and pass bipartisan solutions for Arizona’s Unemployment Insurance system. The results are better benefits for workers and lower tax rates for employers. As a former school board member, I am known for listening to parents, teachers, and students, and I speak up at the Capitol for the support our schools need in order to offer an excellent education and keep qualified educators. As a small business owner, I know first-hand that public policies must provide a supportive environment for your business to compete and grow. I push for fiscal responsibility and government integrity: our tax dollars belong in our pockets and in the programs that help our community, not in the pockets of cronies and special interests. Practical solutions are possible without raising taxes, if we work together. In the AZ Senate, I will continue listening, collaborating and leading to stop the partisan games and build on Arizona’s strengths."

I’ve earned the “Friend of the Family” and the “Hero of the Taxpayer” awards and have led on education funding and teacher pay increases. The Wuhan virus knocked our economy down but today Arizona is the fastest recovered state in the country thanks to our low tax and regulatory burden, and a pro-growth environment that keeps government out of the way and lets the free market do its thing. I have opposed special interests, voted NO on bad bills, and was recently the target of almost $100,000 of dishonest negative attacks from groups that were mad at me because I wouldn’t vote how they tried to tell me to vote. Well I don’t work for them, I work for YOU! I’m running as a team with Beverly Pingerelli and Frank Carroll and we will continue working hard on issues that matter, including water, public safety, health care and more! Thank you!"

Thanks to good decisions, our state's budget is not only balanced, we have been producing large surpluses. Instead of spending that money like the establishment wants, we have paid off debts to save on future interest costs, and then we’ve given the extra revenues back to you in the form of tax cuts. In fact, just last year we passed the biggest tax cut in Arizona history! The left wants to make government bigger and the individual smaller, but we know that America is founded on ideals that are quite the opposite. I fight to maximize individual liberty and to keep government as small as possible. I was and will always be a U.S. Marine and I'm also involved in helping veterans and making Arizona an increasingly veteran-friendly state.
